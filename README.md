# Easy-to-use-Budgeting-Platform
# My project is here to give the user an easy solution to creating a budgeting plan and meet their financial goals. Giving them a platform to increase their financial literacy and ways to manage their money. I tend to aim my audience to any person with income, not just for those with dept or bills, but for those with income or constant income. It will give the user an opportunity to input their spending habits, bills to be paid, and responsibilities. Then the app will take what is inputted and give them a specific plan based on their income, needs, bills, and responsibilities. It will also have a feature where you can link your bank account to your budgeting plan and the platform can give you constant advice on if what your spending is complementary to the budgeting plan. I intend to use Figma to construct a visualization of my application, and I will use InteliJ to code out functions needed to perform the qualities. This is reasonable to achieve in this semester I will use what I have learned so far o continue with my project! I will use tactics such as Inheritance, Abstraction, for-loops, classes, and etc. to perform this code!
