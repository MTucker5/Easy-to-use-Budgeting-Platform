Many people have problems with financial advisement and keeping up with a clear and concise budgeting plan. People especially in working class who have dept and credit that they have to pay off tend to loose track of all the bills and financial statements. Investing in a financial advisor to create a plan can be beneficial but many do not have the finances let alone the time to give to a specific person all while trying to maintain their own money. Also, a person creating their own budgeting plan could lead to confusion or overwhelmingness that could stress them out. Having something fast, convenient, easy to use, and affordable can increase the likelihood of someone to better manage their money and create a budgeting plan with aid and help if need be.
